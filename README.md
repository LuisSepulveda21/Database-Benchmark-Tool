# Database-Benchmark-Tool

DON'T TAKE THIS AS AN OFFICIAL BENCHMARK TOOL, THE RESULTS ARE WRONG ASF BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT WAS MADE.
### About the project: 
This was supposed to be a benchmark about different queries in different db motors but I was lazy to use a random data JSON file and to make decent queries because i had no interest in doing this lol, it was just an uni assigment.
so you could take this as an example of how to use chart.js in DJango :).
